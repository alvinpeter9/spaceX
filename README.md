Working on this project was fun as always.

1]. HAVE I USED API BEFORE? 
Yes i have, i have worked with APIs as well as created my own REST Api. Some of my personal projects with API include:
  HomeNg( https://homeng.vercel.app/ ) is a frontend realestate app made with bayut API, it is fully optimized for mobile and desktop.
  Smart Dictionary ( https://dictionaryapp.vercel.app/ ) was designed with dictionary APi, it is working efficiently and it is fully responsive.
 
2]. HOW WILL I APPROACH THIS PROJECT?
  My first point of approach was to quickly preview the APi endpoints, i was curious to see the data in the api and how best to structure it into my design, after getting a good understanding of the api, utilizing it in my code was easy.
  
3]. GIVEN MORE TIME, WHAT WOULD I IMPROVE ON?
  I love wowing my users with my designs so i would really like to improve on it.
  I would also like to add more funtionality to the app, i would like to consume all the endpoints in the api to create a more interactive and robust web app.
